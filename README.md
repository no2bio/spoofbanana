## spoofbanana

Show mock news site with custom main artice.

*Not a proxy*. Doesn't retain spoofed-site's URL.
Designed for a prank where the user *is* the prankster
(doesn't need to be "fooled" regarding the source,
and since it's a tablet &mdash; the url isn't displayed).

Coming soon - the video ;)

### Dependencies
